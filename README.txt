how to get started

clone this repository into a directory

install "Unity Hub"
  Windows Installer: https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe
  Installing the Unity Hub Page: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html
then in Unity Hub make sure to install Unity 2018 (the exact version I installed is 2018.2.21f1) and
select Android and iOS (if you are on Mac) build support for mobile
select Mac, Windows, or Linux build support depending on your OS


in Unity Hub click "Projects" on the left side of the window and then in the top right click "ADD"
select the directory representing the repository you cloned (should be called ArcadeCarPhysics)
